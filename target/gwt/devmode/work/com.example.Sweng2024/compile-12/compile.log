Compiling module com.example.Sweng2024
   Unification traversed 702 fields and methods and 443 types. 4 are considered part of the current module and 12 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([com.example.client.CercaPage$1$1$1]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
