Compiling module com.example.Sweng2024
   Unification traversed 837 fields and methods and 498 types. 18 are considered part of the current module and 26 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([com.example.client.GiocaPage$7, com.example.client.GiocaPage$3$1, com.example.client.GiocaPage$3$lambda$0$Type, com.example.client.GiocaPage$3$lambda$1$Type]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
