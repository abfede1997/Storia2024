Compiling module com.example.Sweng2024
   Unification traversed 1896 fields and methods and 949 types. 89 are considered part of the current module and 99 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([com.example.client.GiocaPage$3$1, com.example.client.GiocaPage$3$1$1$lambda$0$Type, com.example.client.GiocaPage$3$1$1, com.example.client.GiocaPage$2$lambda$1$Type, com.example.client.GiocaPage$2$lambda$0$Type]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
