Compiling module com.example.Sweng2024
   Unification traversed 1530 fields and methods and 914 types. 58 are considered part of the current module and 68 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([com.example.client.services.RegistrationResult_FieldSerializer, com.example.client.services.RegistrationResult$Map, com.example.client.services.RegistrationResult]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
